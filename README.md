## Dataset

Brazilian E-Commerce Data: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

## Insights Gained

* States which are having the higest number of orders or sales.
* Focusing more on those states like promoting and advertizing will have a higher impact on the Sales Revenue.


* Determining in which part of the year the sales are more or less.
* At what period of time do customers like to buy more.


* Which payment modes do people usually prefer for purchasing goods.
* Using this various offers can be given to customers on their prefered payment mode.

* State-wise visualized on the count of payment modes.

* Popularity of various products into different states.

## What I had tried to achieve
* Which areas are the huge market for our products to better target the customers.
* What time is best for the launch of Big Sales events like Flipkart does on its Big Billion Days and Amazon on its Great Indian Festival that helps them to lure huge customers into their Bussiness.
* Which type of Transactions do people prefer for the payments and from my analysis it's clearly visible that people go over the online transactions rather than COD as this will also help in reducing black money and customers can get more discounts from their bank's cards which will, in turn, give them a good experience on the shopping.
* Which products do people commonly buy in a particular state as this would help us in understanding the customer behavior and then we can give offers and discounts only on the product that people will mostly prefer to buy rather than giving to it to the random products like electronics that most sellers usually give.

## Further Analytics
* Sales of the products have got the most reviews
* Sales of the products that have got a very nice Description
* Delivery time of the products
* Sales of the products that have got the most clear and detailed photos
